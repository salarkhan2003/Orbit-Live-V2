## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.1.0 or higher)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Android device/emulator or iOS simulator

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd public_transport_tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Clerk Authentication**
   - Sign up at [Clerk.com](https://clerk.com)
   - Create a new application
   - Get your publishable API key
   - Update `lib/core/clerk_auth_service.dart`:
   ```dart
   static const String _clerkApiKey = 'pk_test_your_actual_clerk_key_here';
   ```

4. **Configure Google Maps (Optional)**
   - Get Google Maps API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Update `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <meta-data
       android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
       android:value="YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"/>
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   # For Android
   flutter run

   # For iOS (on macOS only)
   flutter run -d ios
   ```

## 📱 App Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. **Login/Signup**: Users can login with email/password or sign up for new account
2. **Role Selection**: After signup, users select their role (Passenger or Driver/Conductor)
3. **Dashboard**: Users are redirected to role-specific dashboard

### Passenger Flow
1. **Dashboard**: Overview with quick actions and recent activity
2. **Live Tracking**: Real-time bus locations on map
3. **Ticket Booking**: Search routes, select buses, generate QR tickets
4. **Pass Management**: Buy and manage monthly/annual passes
5. **SOS**: Emergency feature with location sharing

### Driver Flow
1. **Dashboard**: Trip controls and current status
2. **Trip Management**: Start/stop trips with GPS tracking
3. **Route Selection**: Choose from assigned routes
4. **Passenger Counting**: Track passenger numbers
5. **Logs**: View daily trip history and analytics

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Setup
The app includes development-friendly mock implementations that work without external services:

- **Clerk Auth**: Falls back to local storage for development
- **Google Maps**: Shows placeholder for map integration
- **APIs**: Placeholder implementations for all external services

### Production Setup
For production deployment:

1. **Clerk Configuration**: Add real Clerk API keys
2. **Google Maps**: Configure with actual API key
3. **Backend APIs**: Replace placeholder services with real implementations
4. **Push Notifications**: Configure Firebase Cloud Messaging
5. **Database**: Set up backend with PostgreSQL/MongoDB

## 🌍 Localization

The app supports three languages:
- **English** (default)
- **Hindi** (हिंदी)
- **Telugu** (తెలుగు)

Language can be changed from:
- Login screen (language picker)
- Navigation drawer → Language option
- Settings page
